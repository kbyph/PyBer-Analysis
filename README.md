# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
Ridesharing is the future in transportation services for years to come. Due to the inconveniences of public transportation, ridesharing has provided convenient and safer travels that could possibly become the new norm of society. The purpose of this analysis is to calculate the total fares by each city type included in the data set so that PyBer can help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


## Software
- Anaconda3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.6.1
- Git Bash 2.36.0.windows.1


## Results
Datasets that contained both ride and city data were merged into one to calculate metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver for each of the individual city type.

- From the chart up above, we can see that urban cities contain the most drivers and rides in the area, leading it low price averages and high productions rate. However both smaller cities such as the rural and suburban communities provide less rides as there are less drivers available. Due to small rates, prices remain high until the market grows.

All three city types are projected onto a multiple line chart that helps visualize the total fares across a four month span.

- During this time period, we can see that urban cities produced the highest fares per month as rates typically peaked around March. Urban city revenue remains consistent between the $1500-$2500 range.
- Suburban cities generate a consistent average of $1000 thoughout the time period. Rates seem to have increased in January and begun to decline around March.
- Rural cities generate a maximum of $500 at its highest due to the lack of drivers and demand for a rideshare service. April seems to be the peak month for profit as most of the revenue remains consistent thoughout the year.


## Summary
- Urban cities generate the most yearly revenue, therefore PyBer should invest these areas most in order to maximize on profits. A possible price increase would be ideal when more people decide to utilize ridesharing as their new primary souce of transportation. 

- Suburban cities are still on the rise when utilizing ridesharing and this could be a potential market with a high growth ceiling when performed correctly. PyBer could lower their prices which may encourage user growth.

- Rural cities aren't the most ideal for PyBer to invest in because of its low demand rates. An idea that may help grow the company in these areas would be to provide bonuses and deals for the service. Free rides, discount codes, and memberships for both drivers and riders would significantly revitalize the rural market.
